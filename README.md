# 💻 My LeetCode Solutions

Welcome to my personal repository of LeetCode solutions! This project serves as a comprehensive record of my journey through algorithmic problem-solving, designed to demonstrate mastery across various data structures and algorithm techniques.

The solutions are primarily written in **[Your Primary Language, e.g., Python/JavaScript/C++]** and are structured purely by their assigned difficulty level to make tracking progress and finding solutions easy.

## 📁 Repository Structure

The solutions are categorized into three main folders, reflecting the difficulty assigned by LeetCode.

| Directory | Description | Focus Areas |
 | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **`easy/`** | Foundational problems, great for warming up and ensuring basic syntax and data structure knowledge. | Arrays, Hash Tables, Strings, Simple Traversal |
| **`medium/`** | Intermediate challenges that require understanding core algorithmic patterns. This is where most problem-solving growth occurs. | Two Pointers, Sliding Window, Backtracking, Dynamic Programming (Intro) |
| **`hard/`** | Complex and challenging problems requiring advanced optimization techniques, efficient memory usage, and deep algorithmic insight. | Advanced Dynamic Programming, Graph Algorithms, Advanced Data Structures (Trie, Segment Tree) |

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 📝 Solution Naming Convention

Each solution file follows a consistent naming format to ensure quick identification:

[ProblemNumber]_[ProblemName].[ext]

**Example:**

* `easy/0001_Two_Sum.py`

* `medium/0049_Group_Anagrams.js`

* `hard/0042_Trapping_Rain_Water.cpp`

### 💡 Contributions & Learning

While this is primarily a personal tracking repository, I welcome suggestions for cleaner implementations or discussions on time/space complexity improvements. Feel free to open an issue if you spot an error!
